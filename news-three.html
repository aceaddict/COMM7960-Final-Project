                <p class="section-text" style="text-align: left">
                    An AI think tank has filed a complaint with the FTC in a bid to stop OpenAI from further commercial deployments of GPT-4.

The Center for Artificial Intelligence and Digital Policy (CAIDP) claims OpenAI has violated section five of the FTC Act—alleging the company of deceptive and unfair practices.

Marc Rotenberg, Founder and President of the CAIDP, said:<u>

“The FTC has a clear responsibility to investigate and prohibit unfair and deceptive trade practices. We believe that the FTC should look closely at OpenAI and GPT-4.

We are specifically asking the FTC to determine whether the company has complied with the guidance the federal agency has issued.”

The CAIDP claims that OpenAI’s GPT-4 is “biased, deceptive, and a risk to privacy and public safety”.</u></p>

                            The think tank cited contents in the GPT-4 System Card that describe the model’s potential to reinforce biases and worldviews, including harmful stereotypes and demeaning associations for certain marginalised groups.

In the aforementioned System Card, OpenAI acknowledges that it “found that the model has the potential to reinforce and reproduce specific biases and worldviews, including harmful stereotypical and demeaning associations for certain marginalized groups.”

Furthermore, the document states: “AI systems will have even greater potential to reinforce entire ideologies, worldviews, truths and untruths, and to cement them or lock them in, foreclosing future contestation, reflection, and improvement.”


                            </li>


                </ul>

                <p class="section-text" style="text-align: left">
                    
The CAIDP claims that OpenAI released GPT-4 to the public without an independent assessment of its risks.

Last week, the FTC told American companies advertising AI products:

<u>“Merely warning your customers about misuse or telling them to make disclosures is hardly sufficient to deter bad actors.

Your deterrence measures should be durable, built-in features and not bug corrections or optional features that third parties can undermine via modification or removal.” </u></p>

                <p class="section-text" style="text-align: left">
                    With its filing, the CAIDP calls on the FTC to investigate the products of OpenAI and other operators of powerful AI systems, prevent further commercial releases of GPT-4, and ensure the establishment of necessary guardrails to protect consumers, businesses, and the commercial marketplace.
                    The complaint was filed as Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak, and other AI experts signed a petition to “pause” development on AI systems more powerful than GPT-4.

                                        he long-term impacts of AI on society are still uncertain, as the technology continues to evolve and be integrated into various aspects of our lives. Some potential impacts include increased efficiency and productivity, improved healthcare and education, and new job opportunities. However, AI also has the potential to exacerbate social and economic inequality, and raise ethical concerns regarding data privacy and surveillance. It is important to carefully consider and address these potential impacts as AI continues to advance.

                                        AI can help address global challenges by analyzing and interpreting large amounts of data to identify patterns and trends that humans may miss. For example, AI can be used to monitor weather patterns and predict natural disasters, or to optimize energy usage and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. AI can also help in creating and implementing policies and strategies to combat climate change.

                                        AI for social good has great potential to solve complex problems and benefit society.

These issues must be carefully considered and addressed to ensure that AI is used in an ethical and responsible manner.
